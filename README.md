## Abstract
Just a small demonstration for knative.

## License
The license for the software is LGPL 3.0 or newer. 


## Architecture

tl;dr (ok, only the bullshit bingo words):
- Immutable Objects
- Relying heavily on generated code
- 100 % test coverage of human generated code
- Every line of code not written is bug free!

Code test coverage for human generated code should be 100%, machinge generated code is considered bugfree until proven 
wrong. But every line that needs not be written is a bug free line without need to test it. So aim for not writing code.


## A note from the author
This is a small demo for knative written for the OpenShift Meetup Frankfurt am Main.
